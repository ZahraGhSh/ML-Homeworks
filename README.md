## Intro
This is a machine learning library developed by Zahra Gholami Shiri for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

## Descision Trees
creating and training a decision tree model from tree structure json file 

## Linear Regression
Different methods including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and analytical solution for LSM were implemented and included. To get the results using the data, clone the repository and run bash script run.sh in the LinearRegression directory

## Ensemble Learning
The machine learning ensemble methods taught in class including Bagged Trees, Random Forrest and AdaBoost were implemented and included in the code in this directory. To get the results using the data, clone the repository and run bash script run.sh in the EnsembleLearning directory
